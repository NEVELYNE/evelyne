# To send me your changes:
###create a branch from the main branch
1. -git checkout -b {your branch name without these "brackets"}
eg git checkout -b eves
now you will be uploading to this branch not to your main branch inorder to avoid the main branch from crashing!!

### add your files to this branch
2. -git add . (don't forget the last "." which means add all)

### commit your changes to this branch
3. -git commit -m "Tell the collaborator what you have added or changing"

### push your changes to github
4. -git push origin <<branch_name>>[in this case eves]


## I will be able to see those changes and I mearge them with the main branch

####Then if I want your changes to merge with those I have loally, I do:-
5. -git pull origin master
